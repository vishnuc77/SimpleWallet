Simple Wallet

This is a smart contract written in solidity where any user can send money to the contract and Owner can then add allowances to particular addresses. These addresses can only withdraw amount which is less than or equal to that allowance. Inherited the functionality of owner from Openzeppelin's Ownable abstract contract.
